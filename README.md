# README

# My first Ruby on Rails project is this tutorial

## The tutorial covers not only Rails basics and deeper knowledge of the framewok, but also important information on Git and version control which is the point of this README file.

This is the first application for the Ruby on Rails tutorial.

  * You can find it at https://www.railstutorial.org/ and it was created by Michael Hartl whose page you can find at https://www.michaelhartl.com/

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions
